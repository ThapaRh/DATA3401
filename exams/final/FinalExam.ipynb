    "This final exam is simliar to the midterm exam. Please work the exercises below **on your own**.  When you have completed the exam, you should push your completed jupyter notebook to your GitHub repo for this class in the **Exams->Final** folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may not discuss the problems with **anyone else**, including persons on an online internet forum. Consulting an outside source like this will be considered an academic integrity violation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use all class resources including previous labs and lectures, and anything posted on the course GitHub repo. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may not use any function that trivializes a problem. For example, if I ask you to write a `max` function that computes the maximum entry in a list, you are not allowed to use the pre-defined Python function `max`; you must write your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each problem below (including the Bonus) will be worth approximately 20 points. Achieving over 100 on this exam is possible if the Bonus is completed."

    "## Exercise 3\n",
    "In Lab 7 you coded a random walk in 1-dimension. Here you will code a 2-dimensional random walk.  \n",
    "1. As before, write a function `random_walk(num_steps,init_position)` that takes an integer for `num_steps` corresponding to how many steps the random walker will take, and a numpy array for `init_position` with x and y coordinates of the starting point. The function should return the full sequence of positions of the walker as they take `num_steps` steps\n",
    "1. To determine the next location of the walker at a given step, the walker uniformly randomly chooses to walk one of 4 possible directions: up, down, left, or right and takes a step of length 1 in either direction (e.g., if the walker starts at (0,0), their possible moves for the first step are up=(0,1), down=(0,-1), left=(-1,0), right=(1,0))\n",
    "1. Call your `random_walk` function 5 times with initial position of (0,0) and 10,000 steps and plot the random walk for each function call using pyplot (here is an example of what it should look like; if the image does not render in GitHub, open 2drandomwalk.png in the Final folder)\n",
    "![2drandomwalk.png](2drandomwalk.png)\n",
    "1. What do you notice?\n",
    "1. Modify your random walk such that the walker is more likely to travel up (specifically, they will step up with probability .7 and the remaining directions each with probability .1).\n",
    "1. Call your modified random walk function 5 times and plot the results.\n",
    "1. What do you notice? Is there a difference in behavior compared to the original version?"

If `shuffled` is False, the deck should be in order (Ace-2 of Spades, Ace-2 of Clubs, Ace-2 of Diamonds, Ace-2 of Hearts), otherwise if `shuffled` is True, the deck should be randomly ordered\n",
    "    1. Create a method `deal_cards(num_cards)` that chooses the **first** `num_cards` cards from the deck and returns a list of these cards. This method should also remove the cards from the deck.\n",
